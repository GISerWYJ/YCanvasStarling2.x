# YCanvasStarling2.x
This is a port of YCanvas (https://github.com/jozefchutka/YCanvas) maps for Starling 2.x

Small demo inside of app:
- Demo creates with Flash Builder 4.7 AIR 23 Starling 2.1 & Feathers 3.0.4 

Main classes:
- CMapHelperMain - create all work to initialize the maps. So u can choose type of maps in 'var config:MapConfig = ...' (OSM is prefered), or add your custom server maps.
Easy to set up markers on map (just call addMarkerAt(pt:Point) ) and manage TOUCHES by Screen,  and add overlay UI such as Feathers 3.x (in parent class). 

Feel free to make issues and create any updates of it
